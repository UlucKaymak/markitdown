# Mark it down

**Mark It Down** is a Markdown reader and editor designed to keep you away from clutter, allowing you to focus solely on your text and thoughts.

**Personal Note:** I searched for a good markdown editors, they want  much effort to use. This is the best for my use case. (Note taking, blogging, reading and writing GDDs and Reports.)

* It has some visual bugs in windows. But nothing works broken systematically.
* Open With function has problems with MacOS.

## I have one big problem
There is no noterisation option for current position of this app. So your OS can say "This is broken" or "This can be harmful".
_But it's not._
